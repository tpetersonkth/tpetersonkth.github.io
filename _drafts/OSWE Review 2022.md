# Introduction

In December last year, I decided to start studying for the Offensive Security Web Expert (OSWE) certification. This certificate is given to anyone who passes the exam related to the Advanced Web Attacks Eploitation (AWAE) course provided by Offensive Security. I bought 90 days of access to the AWAE course and got started the 11th december. Prior to this, I had around 1 year and 9 months of experience working with penetration testing. Most of my penetration tests concerned web applications and were performed as white-box penetration tests, meaning that I had the source code available while testing. As such, I was reasonably familiar with navigating large code bases in order to find vulnerabilites. 

In Mars, I attempted and passed the exam on my first attempt. The goal of this post is to help anyone who hasn't started their OSWE journey yet or is in the middle of it. In this post, I will describe my journey and provide tips on how to get the most out of the AWAE course. I won't disclose any information concerning what the lab exercises and extra miles are about, as Offensive Security forbids this. In addition, I won't provide any information concerning the exam machines, for obvious reasons. I will, however, present how much time I spent on different course related activities and present a set of tips for getting the most out of the AWAE course and increasing the probability of passing the OSWE exam. 

# My Journey

My lab access started the 11th December and ended the 11th Mars. I then took 2 weeks of rest before attempting the exam to ensure that I would have enough energy to work despise any potential sleep deprivation.

Mention time off from work

Time table

The longest I was stuck on an extra miles was 3 days. If you are stuck, take a break and try again. Also, just like the OSCP, we OSWE course comes with access to a community forum where other students can give you hints on how to solve the exercises and extra miles. In addition, there is a discord server x. Rule: Don't look at hints unless you are completely lost.

In the beginning, I tried to do a chapter a day. This included reading the course book, watching the related videos and completing the exercises. Since some chapters were longer or shorter as well as easier or harder, I would sometimes get stuck a bit longer on some chapters. The time I spent studying during the lab access is presented in the table below. Note that this table includes 91 days since it contains 89 full days and 2 half-days.

The days x I had been given time from work to study or had taken vacation days.

Always make sure to try on your own before. I made a rule for myself that I would never check any hints unless I had spent two whole days on a challenge.

To prepare for the exam, I had mounted a camera on a tripod since the proctorers needed to half of my body, as shown in the picture above. In addition, I had bought a lot of snacks which are shown in the image below. These included. I also placed two extra set of earphones, my passport and a pair of earplugs to have these available if needed.

Finally, I attempted the 48 hour exam (+24 hours for sending in the report) for the first time on Saturday 25/3 at 9 AM. I felt a bit nervous before doing the exam as I knew that I wasn't going to sleep much and expected to feel quite frustrated. However, thanks to all the preparation I had been doing, the exam was slightly easier than I expected and a lot of fun! In around  After almost 70 hours with only 6 hours of sleep, I handed in my 58 pages long exam report (At 5:AM). Around 24 hours later, I received an email informing me that I had passed! :D


Overall, both the labs and the exam was a quite enjoyable experience (apart from the lack of sleep during the exam).


# Tips
In this section, I provide any tips I would give someone who has yet to do the OSWE. In the next section, 



* Learn to use the Python [requests]() library very well.

Such as the automated script written [here](Holiday Auto exploit link)

{% highlight none linenos %}
Checklist Before Lab Access:
* Do all the Hack the Box listed in TJNulls OSWE preparation list.
* Learn how routing works in PHP, Java, NodeJS and .NET.

Checklist During Lab Access:
* Read the course book, watch the videos and do the exercises while taking notes.
* Do the extra miles.
* Review the notes.
* Do the three extra lab machines
* There are more vulnerabilites in the lab machines than those mentioned in the exercises and extra miles of the course literature. See if you can find them (See the forums for hints)
* Book the exam (Open slots are usually around 3 months away).

Checklist After Lab Access:
* Review your notes
* Ensure that you have read the exam guide, have snacks ready, your passport and a camera that you can mount appropriately.
* Make sure to relax before the exam. (You don't want to burn out).
