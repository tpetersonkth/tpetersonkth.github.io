# Introduction
The hack the box machine "Falafel" is a hard machine which is included in [TJnull's OSWE Preparation List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/edit#gid=665299979). Exploiting this machine requires knowledge in the areas of arbitrary file uploads, PHP comparisions

By enumerating the target, it is possible to discover 

# Exploitation
We start by performing an nmap scan by executing `nmap -sS -sC -sV -p- 10.10.10.85`. The `-sS`, `-sC` and `-sV` flags instruct nmap to perform a SYN scan to identify open ports followed by a script and version scan on the ports which were identified as open. The `-p-` flag instructs nmap to scan all the ports on the target. From the scan results, shown below, we can see that 

![nmap](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/nmap.png)

If we navigate to the web server, we are met with the page below. It doesn't contain much except or a link to a login page and a link "Home" leading to the page we are already on. The login page has the extension `.php` meaning that we are dealing with a php application.

![loginPHP](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/loginPHP.png)

We can use ffuf to guess directory and file names, as shown below. We specify the target host with the `-u` flag, specify file extensions with the `-e` flag, choose a wordlist using the `-w` flag and set the `-ic` flag to instruct the tool to ignore comments in the wordlist file.

cyberlaw.txt

Visiting all the 302 results in login page
style.php - Contains styling for the website. Probably, this file is included in other php files to style every page of the website. header.php and footer.php contains the header of the website and is also included in all php files

Visiting robots.txt provides no interesting information about any hidden directories or files.
We are also not interested in any 200 OK with 0 bytes (connction.php).

403 is forbidden => not interesting

In conclusion, there are two files left that are interesting to us. The first is cyberlaw.txt since it resulted in a 200 ok and contains data. The second is upload.php since the name suggests that it allows users to upload files, meaning that we could potentially use this page to obtain RCE. However, we would first need to have access to a valid account to access this functionality.

Navigating to [10.10.10.73/cyberlaw.txt](10.10.10.73/cyberlaw.txt) results in the page below. This page contains an email stating that there is a known problem with the authentication of the website and that there is an issue with a file upload feature which might lead to remote code execution on the target. In addition, it informs us that `admin` and `chris` might be valid usernames.

![cyberLawTXT](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/cyberLawTXT.png)

TODO: Background on php type juggling.

Trying to login with "admin" and "240610708" results in a successful login! We can strongly suspect that the authentication check looks something like md5(password) == "0e..."

<div style="overflow-x:auto;">
<table class="customTable"><tr><th>Hash Type</th><th>Hash Length</th><th>Input</th><th>Magic Hash</th></tr>
<tr><td>MD2</td><td>32</td><td>505144726</td><td>0e015339760548602306096794382326</td></tr>
<tr><td>MD4</td><td>32</td><td>48291204</td><td>0e266546927425668450445617970135</td></tr>
<tr><td>MD5</td><td>32</td><td>240610708</td><td>0e462097431906509019562988736854</td></tr>
<tr><td>SHA-1</td><td>40</td><td>10932435112</td><td>0e07766915004133176347055865026311692244</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

We have the usernames chris and admin. We can try to log in with each password in the Input field of the table for each account. Upon doing this, it is possible to notice that we can log in with the username admin and password "240610708".

![adminLogin](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/adminLogin.png)

What has happened is probably that the authentication portion of the code has an if clause like `passwordHash == md5(receivedPassword)` where passwordHash is the stored password hash for the admin user and receivedPassword is the password we provided. If `passwordHash` can be casted to a float with a numeric value of `0`, we will pass the check since we know that `md5(receivedPassword)` becomes `0e462097431906509019562988736854` and loose comparision is used. For example, if we assume that `passwordHash` is `0e12345678123456781234567812345678`, the comparision would result in `true`, as can be seen below.

We can start a python server by executing `python3 -m http.server 80

![badExtension](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/badExtension.png)
mv webShell.php webShell.php.png

![uploadPNG](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/uploadPNG.png)

However, if we rename the file to 250 `A` characters followed by `.png` and try to reupload it, we can see that the upload is successful but that the filename was truncated since it was too long.

mv webShell.php.png AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.png

![tooLong](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/tooLong.png)
The new filename is not shown since it is too long to be rendered properly. However, we can see it by inspecting the source of the page or by inspecting the response in a proxy tool such as BrupSuite, as shown below. 

![tooLongName](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/tooLongName.png)

By counting the number of characters in the new file name, we can conclude that the length limit is 236 characters and that any filename longer than that will be truncated at this limit. As such, we can try to upload a file with a name that consists of 232 `A` characters followed by `.php.png`. This should pass the extension filter but save the file with the extension `.php`.

filename length limitation of 236 characters. If we look closely at the output, we can see that the last part of the filename is being truncated. This 


We know that hte web root is /var/www/html
We can see that the file was uploaded to x and should have the name AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.php

![uploadWS](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/uploadWS.png)

![RCE](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/RCE.png)

We can use the reverse shell payload below to acquire a shell.

We url-encode it, execute `nc -lvp 443` to start a netcat listener and execute it using the web shell. Once the server has processed the request, the server connects back to our listener and provides us with a shell, as can be seen below.
