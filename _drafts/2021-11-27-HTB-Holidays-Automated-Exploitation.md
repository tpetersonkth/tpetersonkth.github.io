# Introduction
The hack the box machine "Holidays" is a hard machine which requires knowledge in the areas of user agent filtering, SQL injections, XSS filter evasion, command injection and NodeJS packages. In this post, we study the coding mistakes behind the vulnerabilites and how to remediate them. Spotting vulnerabilties through code reviews is a very useful skill when performing white-box penetration testing, hence why writeups like this one might be useful!
