# Introduction
The hack the box machine "Holidays" is a hard machine which requires knowledge in the areas of user agent filtering, SQL injections, XSS filter evasion, command injection and NodeJS packages. In this post, we study the coding mistakes behind the vulnerabilites and how to remediate them. Spotting vulnerabilties through code reviews is a very useful skill when performing white-box penetration testing, hence why writeups like this one might be useful!

# Summary of the Exploitation
Login with the username rickA and password "nevergonnagiveyouup". start a web server. Inject an xss payload to leak the admin session cookie. Use the admin session cookie to login to the web site and exploit a table lookup feature to achieve remote code execution. Then, abuse sudo privileges on NPM packages to

# Overview
This exploit requires the usage of threads, mutexes and several listeners. For an explanation of the listener, see x.
