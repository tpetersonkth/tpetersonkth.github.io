As someone working with penetration testing on a daily basis, there are several challenges which I encounter which are unclear how to solve. Most of the time, these challenges can be solved by searching online for other people who have had the same issue and found a solution. However, this is not always possible. This is why I created this blog, to create posts which would have helped someone in my position when they couldn't find the solution anywhere else online.

I hope you will enjoy the posts I have made and will make while also finding that they improve your cyber security expertise. :)
