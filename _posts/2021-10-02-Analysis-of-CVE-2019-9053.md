# Background:
This weekend I was doing some HTB machines to prepare for the OSWE certification. One of the recommended machines was `Writeup`. This machine is vulnerable to [CVE-2019-9053](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9053) which has a corresponding exploit on [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46635).

When reading the exploit, I noticed the payload variable (Shown at line x below). A variable named "payload" was used multiple times in different functions and always started with the string “a,b,1,5))”. While the rest of the payload was intuitive and easy to understand, I didn't understand why the prefix was needed. I searched the internet for answers but struggled to find any. So I decided to dig into the source code of “CMS made simple”.


{% capture some_var %}
```python
def dump_username():
    global flag
    global db_name
    global output
    ord_db_name = ""
    ord_db_name_temp = ""
    while flag:
        flag = False
        for i in range(0, len(dictionary)):
            temp_db_name = db_name + dictionary[i]
            ord_db_name_temp = ord_db_name + hex(ord(dictionary[i]))[2:]
            beautify_print_try(temp_db_name)
            payload = "a,b,1,5))+and+(select+sleep(" + str(TIME) + ")+from+cms_users+where+username+like+0x" + ord_db_name_temp + "25+and+user_id+like+0x31)+--+"
            url = url_vuln + "&m1_idlist=" + payload
            start_time = time.time()
            r = session.get(url)
            elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
            if elapsed_time >= TIME:
                flag = True
                break
        if flag:
            db_name = temp_db_name
            ord_db_name = ord_db_name_temp
    output += '\n[+] Username found: ' + db_name
    flag = True
```
{% endcapture %}
{% assign some_var = some_var | markdownify %}
{% include fixlinenos.html code=some_var %}

From the exploit code, it was also possible 

The final URL is something like: http://[IP]/writeup/moduleinterface.php?mact=News,m1_,default,0&m1_idlist=[payload]



# Investigating CVE-2019-9053
I downloaded got the source code from the htb machine after exploiting it and rooting it by transfering all the files from the /var/www/html directory to my local computer. Next, I opened the top-most directory in the text editor VSCode. In VSCode, I searched for the parameter name “m1_idlist” but got no results. I then searched for “idlist” since I thought that the underscore character ("_") might just be a delimiter.


Among the results, the entries from the “action.default.php” looked interesting.


In this code, the value of the idlist parameter is assigned to the $idlist variable(Line 60). Then, it is ensured that the $idlist variable is a string(Line 61). Next, the "explode" function is called to split the $idlist string into an array by splitting on “,”. Then, a for loop is used to ensure that each element in the “$tmp” array is an integer. Afterwards (at line 67), the $idlist variable is assigned to the filtered $tmp array and any duplicates are removed. Finally, the filtered integers in the $idlist variable are placed in a string which is appended to the $query1 variable (line 68). This $query1 string is then evaluated by the database later on in the code.

The problem in this code is the usage of the count and unset functions in the for loop. The count function counts the element in an array while the unset function removes an element from an array. At the first line of the for loop, the element at index $i of the $tmp variable is casted to an int. What is important to understand here is that php does not through an error if the string to cast to an int could not be casted to an int. Instead, it returns 0. As such, the next line tries to filter out any strings which could not be converted to an integer (Probably negative values were unwanted as well, hence the expression "< 1" instead of “=== 0” ). The problem here, however, is that after removing an item with the unset function, the length of the array is decreased by one, meaning that count($tmp) will be decreased by one as well. As such, the filter can be bypassed by sending a negative number followed by a comma character and a payload!

To make this clear, consider the value $idlist = “,evil”. At the first iteration of the for loop at line 63, we have $i = 0,  $tmp = ["","evil"] and count($tmp) = 2. Since $i < count($tmp), we enter the body of the for loop. At line 63, the empty string “” is converted to an integer, resulting in the integer 0. Then, this element is removed from the array since 0 < 1 is true. Finally, the end of the for loop is reached and $i is incremented by one. The for loop condition $i < count($tmp) is then checked again. At this point, the values are  $i = 1,  $tmp = ["evil"] and count($tmp) = 1 which means that the body of the for loop is not entered. As such, the last element can evade the filter and reach the query string, resulting in the blind sqli vulnerability!

The last thing to notice is the format of the string which is appended to the query. Since the array $idlist only contains the element “evil”, the expression implode(',',$idlist) simply results in the string “evil”. As such, we can change this element to 1))[SQLI_Payload] where [SQLI_Payload] is an sql injection payload, since this would close the two opening parenthesis and comment out the rest of the query. In conclusion, this means that a blind sql injection attack can be performed by setting the idlist variable to ,1))[SQLI_Payload]. This will create the expression '(mn.news_id IN (1)) [SQLI_payload] )) AND ' at line 68. An easy exploitation example is to force the database software to wait a couple of seconds. This can be performed by setting the value of the idlist variable to ,1)) and sleep(5)#. URL encoding this payload and placing it in the URL results in this proof of concept link where [IP] is the ip address of the HTB machine named “writeup”: https://[IP]/writeup/moduleinterface.php?mact=News,m1_,default,0&m1_idlist=,1))+and+sleep(5)%23

Add(?): Possible to note that the vulnerability was only present in the News module from online sources and a blind sqli)
