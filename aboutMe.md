Hello!

My name is Thomas and I work as a security engineer at one of the largest banks in Sweden. Before my current position, I worked as a pentest consultant, performing pentests for a variery of clients in a cascade of industries. While studying for my Computer Science degree, I also worked as a teach assistant in the courses "Ethical hacking" and "Advanced ethical hacking" at KTH in Stockholm. 

Outside of work, I also spend some time playing CTF:s or hacking hack the box machines. Apart from that, I enjoy attending it-security conferences and doing small projects in python.

For anyone who want to get to know me better, or have someone to play CTFs with, I am available on [Linkedin](https://se.linkedin.com/in/thomas-peterson-sweden). :)
